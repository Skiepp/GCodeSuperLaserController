GCodeSuperLaserController
=========================
This is a basic plugin to work with a Laser Engraver.
Printing from the OctoPrint interface with this plugin can turn your 3D printer into a laser engraver!

Commands
--------
- **M3 \<p\>**:  Turns ON the laser with power <p>
- **M4** / **M5**:  Turn OFF the laser

The laser power can go from 1 (min) to 255 (MAX)
**NOTE:** It's highly suggested to add an [**M400** - Finish Moves](http://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M400.html) before the M3 and M4/M5 commands.

How to Use
----------

Step 0) Install the plugin

Step 1) Connect the Laser driver to pins GPIO18 and GND

Step 2) Create a GCode using the described commands

Step 3) Print **using Octoprint**


**Have fun :)** 
Oh, almost forgot, I'm not responsible for you hurting yourself with your cool laser, but please use it with caution.
